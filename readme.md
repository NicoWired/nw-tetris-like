# About the project
Just a small Tetris clone I developed to improve as a gamdev, and I decided to share it in case anyone here finds the code useful or enjoys the game!

It's completely free and open source, and it implements pretty much everything you'd expect from a Tetris game, with the exception of wall kicks. If there's any interest, I could work a bit further to add some missing features and eye candy.

Here are my [socials](https://linktr.ee/nicowired) in case you want to reach out, always fun meeting new people!

## Controls
These are the default controls, but you can change them in the settings (you'll need to change them if you don't have a numpad):
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
- S (hold): Soft drop
- Keypad 7: Rotate counterclockwise
- Keypad 8: Rotate clockwise
- Keypad 4: Hold piece
- Keypad 5: Hard drop
- Enter: Start playing / Pause

## ToDo
I may or may not implement some of these improvements in the future.
- Make GUI a bit less hideous
- Add music
- Add sfx
- Add controller support
- Add wallkicks
